# odin-tic-tac-toe
The Tic Tac Toe project from the JavaScript/Node track of The Odin Project

# Description

My implementation of the Tic Tac Toe application project for The Odin Project.

I would like to say that the win validation implementation was based on [Web Dev Simplified's](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified/) Tic Tac Toe application from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM). After wracking my brain for about an hour over how to tackle this and entirely ruling out implementing a Magic Square algorithm (because I thought that to be overkill) I found his video and it was exactly what I needed, so thank you brother I owe you this special mention.
